	<h2>LAYER 2 OF THE OSI MODEL</h2>
	<p>
	The second layer of the OSI model is the Datalink layer.
management system deals the knowledge of how data stored and managed on a computerized 
information system. In any organization, it requires accurate and reliable data for better decision 
making, ensuring privacy of data and controlling data efficiently.
The examples include deposit and/or withdrawal from a bank, hotel, airline or railway reservation, 
purchase items from supermarkets in all cases, a database is accessed.

		<h2>LAYER 3 OF THE OSI MODEL</h2>
        <P>The 3 of the osi model is the network layer. 
        It is reponsible for routing and fowarding data packets between different networks. this 
         layer uses logical addressing (such as IP addresses) to determine the best path for data packetsto reach their destiantion. </P>
         <h3>Key features Of The Network Layer Include: </h3>
		 <ol>
		<li>Routing: The network layer determines the best path for data packets to travel between different networks. This involves 
		making decisions based on network topology,congestions levels, and other factors.</li>
		<li>Addressing: The network layer assigns logical addresses to devices on a network, 
			such as IP addresses. These addresses are used to identify devices and determine where data packets should be sent. </li>
		<li>Fragmentation and reasssembly: The network layer is responsible for breaking down data 
			packets in to smaller segments for transmission across a network, and then reassembling them at the destination.</li>
		<li>Error handling: The network layer may also include error detection and correction
			 mechanisms to ensure that data packets are delivered accurately.</li>
		<li>Quality of service (QoS): The network layer can priorize certain types of traffic
			 over others, such as giving priority to voice or video to ensure a better user experience.</p>
		</li>	
		 </ol>
		<h3>Network Layer Protocols</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>IP(Internet Protocol)</li>
			<li>ICMP(Internet Control Messaging Protocol)</li>
			<li>ARP(Address Resolution Protocol)</li>
		</ol>

	<h2> LAYER 4 OF THE OSI MODEL </h2>
		<p> The layer 4 protocol of the OSI model is the Transport layer.This layer is responsible for ensuring that the data is delivered in the correct order and retransmitted if errors occur.
		<h3>Key Services Of The Transport Layer </h3>
		<ol>
		<li>Connection-Oriented Communication: Establishes a connection between devices 
		before data is sent,ensuring that data is delivered in the correct order and retransmitted if errors occur.
	</li>
		<li>Connectionless Communication: Sends data without establishing a connection first,
			but still provides error detection and correction.</li>
		<li>Flow Control: Regulates the amount of data send to prevent network congestion.
		</li>
		<li>Error Control And Correction: Detects and corrects errors that occur during data transmission</li>
		<li>Multiplexing And Demultiplexing: Allows multiple applications to share the same connection 
		and enables multiple devices to communicate over the same network.</li>
		</ol>
		The Transport layer plays a crucial role in ensuring that data is delivered reliably and efficiently over a network,and is an essential part of the OSI model.
		<h3><center>Transport layer protocols <center></h3>
		<ol>
		<li>Transmission Control Protocol(TCP:A connection-Oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transfer.</li>
		<li>User Datagram Protocol(UDP):A connectionless protocol that provides best-effort delivery of data.</li>
		<li>Datagram congestion Control Protocol(DCCP):A connection-oriented protocol that provides congestion control and reliability for real-time applications.</li>
		<li>Internet Layer(IL):A protocol that provides connection-oriented and connectionless services for the transport layer</li>
		</ol>
